# denoising-seidel-aberration-repo
Seidel aberrations causes shift variant blurring in images . Our goal is to reduce those aberrations using modern Deep-Learning algorithms to restore clear images.
Project is in progress!

1. Simulation of Seidel aberrations- Done
2. Benchmarking it with traditional deconvolutional methods - Continuing
2. Design and training of Deep models for deconvolution-Continuing
3. Phase mask optimization to deblurr and reconstruct images.
